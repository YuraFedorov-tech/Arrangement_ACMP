A permutation of N elements is an ordered set of N distinct numbers from 1 to N.
A placement of order K is a subset of elements of some permutation of order N. For example, (1, 3) is a placement of order 2 for a permutation (1, 2, 3) of order 3.
Required for a given placement to determine its position in the lexicographical order of all possible placements formed from all possible permutations of order N.

For example, the lexicographic sequence of possible placements for K=2 and N=3 is as follows:
(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)
Thus, move (2,3) has number 4 in this sequence.
